I should have done this a longgggg time ago, but oh well! Never too late!

Sometimes, when I look at people, in my head I’m just like “Wow, you are so beautiful”—what I mean by that is “Wow, you manage to exemplify so much of who I want to be, and I fuck with you soooo much,” but I like to keep it simple because that’s what those people are: beautiful.

I’m so **so** thankful to have met so many of those beautiful people, and I don’t think I say it enough. I go to school because I can see Finn dancing around in the hallways, Eric tracing every step of a derivation in Sharaf’s class, and Zidane scrolling brainrot on maximum volume. I feel so lucky because I got to talk to Pranjal in English, take pictures with Shaurya and Carmin instead of doing work in Cyber, and point and wave at Andrew Liu and see him do the same thing back. The craziest thing though? Some of these people have chosen to make me a part of their daily lives—Donghyun always sends me reels even though he’s on vacation in Korea, Eliezer and Julian average 5 “hi”’s an hour in my DMs, and Anthony habitually wakes up from his slumber to take me to the library to grind out some random work that we somehow assigned ourselves.

I remember when Mr. Wan told me about the reason why he teaches: he teaches because he’s always reminded of how incredible people can be by his students—he sees how empathetic, incredible, creative, and [insert any other positive adjective] his students can be. I think what he says is more believable if you’ve ever complained to Intia and had her patiently listen for hours and hours until it suddenly hit 2 AM, if you seen Daniel work on his robot until he’d faint and somehow do it all over again the next day, or if you met all of the other beautiful people that I’ve been lucky enough to meet.

This has already turned into a huge wall of text, even though I lowkey didn’t want that to happen lol (I mean whos slogging through this entire thing?). Anyway, if you’re reading this—thank you! You’re one of those absolutely beautiful people that I’ve been talking about. And I’m so sorry that we didn’t get to spend more time together.

But, now it’s off to MIT
