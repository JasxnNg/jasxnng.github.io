<h1>Hi, I'm Jason.</h1>

This is the homepage to my website—I don't really have a good way to transition into an actual introduction, so I guess this will have to do. Maybe you'll have a better idea for how I can do these things, and if you do (or, if you just want to chat) please feel free to reach out! My contacts are hyperlinked on the sidebar.

About Me
=======
I love learning about experimental physics, theoretical computer science, and presidential history. I'm really interested in learning 'how I know what I know' (more on this later in the blogs!)—understanding how we can derive all of the wonderful equations in physics and how we can control random grains of silicon to do funny stuff in computer science makes me uncontrollably giddy. Aside from academics, I love weightlifting, reading, and talking to my friends. Don't get me started on talking—I can talk for hours over a dessert from <a href= "https://www.sweetmomentnyc.com/" target ="_blank">Sweet Moment</a> or peanut noodles from <a href="http://www.shujiaofuzhou.com/" target ="_blank">Shujiao Fuzhou</a>.

Right now, I want to learn more about computer networking, cybersecurity, statistical mechanics, protein folding, abstract algebra, and presidential history. Sometimes, I have an urge to make radish kimchi, but I haven't gotten around to doing that just yet. 

Currently, I
====
<ul>
<li>am an incoming freshman @ MIT, looking to do some semi-sensible combination of CS (6-3), Physics (8), Math (18), and History (21H).</li>
<li>will be interning at Amazon next summer as apart of the <a href="https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/scholarships" target= "_blank">Amazon Future Engineer Scholarship</a></li>
<li>am jamming out to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/36aY2VhOBpgnExFZL1mBH2?si=ad50fa8b6d364d94" target="_blank">Colossal Loss</a> on Niki's new album, Buzz.</li>
<li></li>

</ul>

Previously, I 
====
<ul>
<li>worked with my parents at a fruit stand in Brooklyn, NY.</li>
<li>tinkered a little bit with electrical engineering @ MIT BWSI</li>
<li>was a mentee @ Google, working on projects involving <a href="https://github.com/Keobkeig/Science-Questions-Study-Tool" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing</a> and <a href = "https://github.com/Keobkeig/Foo-Food-Fighters" target ="_blank">Computer Vision</a>.</li>
<li>had a blast doing Science Olympiad in high school, where I competed for Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Inquiry events.</li>
<li>learned how to make spam fried rice and took my talents to Cambridge</li>

</ul>
